# eXist-db and Web Components - Part 3

In part 1 i gave a very high-level introduction to Web Components while Part 2 dealt with the use of components within eXist-db.

In this part finally we dive into Web Components in an XML world. The ideas presented here should be considered research and are certainly subject of discussion. However there are some interesting aspects that have been proven in a prototype application whose parts will be explained here.

## XML and the Web

While XML is extremely widespread in many domains it didn't really make it into the browser. XML can be displayed and even styled but when it comes to editing HTML and XML do not integrate well. Whenever you want to make XML documents available on the Web you have to convert it to HTML in one way or another.

Main reason for that are:
* XML can have namespaces - HTML not
* XML is well-formed while HTML doesn't need to be

Browsers treat XML as they treat any other format they know of - the contents is displayed but the support ends there. There's not even a standard way of using XPath to query the XML.

Furthermore when we mix up the two we also get into a clash of worlds: Web Developers often hate XML because of its rigidness and its use of namespaces. XML developers like it because of this rigidness which makes it easy to parse and manipulate with the tons of freely available tools out there.
